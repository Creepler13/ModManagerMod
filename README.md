# ModManagerMod

Version 1.0.0
  All funtions are working (Enable,disable,update and install from https://github.com/MDModsDev/ModLinks)
  
  This Mod has still some things that need to be polished
  
     - The ui is a bit lacking
     - The Delete button misses a Confirmation window
     - Maybe a search bar for the install tab
     
     
This has only been tested on my own PC so if there are any bugs please report them on the MDMC discord or directly as an Issue on github
