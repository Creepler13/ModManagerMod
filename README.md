# ModManagerMod

Version 1.0.0
  All funtions are working (Enable,disable,update and install from https://github.com/MDModsDev/ModLinks)
  
  This Mod ha still some things that need to be Polished
  
     - The ui is a bit lacking
     - The Delete button misses a Confirmation window
     - Maybe a search bar for the install tab
     
     
This has only been Tested on my own PC so if there are any bugs please report them on the MDMC discord
